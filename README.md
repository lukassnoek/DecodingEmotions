# DecodingEmotions

All analyses scripts for the Decoding Emotions study, which will be submitted as:
Oosterwijk, Snoek, Rotteveel, Barrett, & Scholte. (in prep). Shared states: Using MVPA to test neural overlap between self-focused emotion imagery and other-focused emotion understanding.

Note that this repository only contains scripts. The underlying algorithms, preprocessing functions, and other necessities for the machine learning pipeline come mostly from the *scikit-learn* package (http://scikit-learn.org/) and the *skbold* package (https://github.com/lukassnoek/skbold). The latter package is being developed alongside my PhD-project and includes some tools to make the construction of machine learning pipelines easier.

The folder *statistics* contain Jupyter Notebooks that document how statistics have been calculated, how plots have been constructed, and other things that accompany the submitted manuscript.
